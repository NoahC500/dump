## Disclaimer

I wrote this between around 23:00 & 01:00 one night, there are probably inconsistencies, but I hope it helps to improve the act if the HO's duties do not much change, and so if the duties do change, a better foundation is there to build off of :)

## Conflict with Government Act 2024

- For the conflict with the Government (Department Size Clarification) Act 2024 & its associated section in the Government Act 2024, see the below point on 1(7).

- 2(6) of the Government Act 2024 states that "The \[PM posseses] the perogative to determine the \[iC] of \[Ministers.]"

>However, this act clearly states that the Home Sec. is 5iC and the W&P Sec. is 6iC.. Whilst the PM does, under 3(1) of this act, have the ability to amend 1., I feel that if an amendment to an act is needed to make this change then it's a bit silly, especially with the state of our online SLR.

>I therefore recommend that all iC levels are struck from this act.

- This act states that there is to be a ***Secretary*** for W&P.

>This is weird for multiple reasons.

>1. The Dept. for W&P is not part of the HO in real life.
>2. The Gov. Act states that the deputy is to be a ***Minister*** of State, ***not*** a ***Secretary*** of State.

>Therefore, I suggest that the W&P Sec. post is removed and replaced with a 'Minister of State for Security' as this is an actual HO role ***or*** with a 'Minister of State for the Home Department' in line with my above recommendations on the naming of the dept. and as they will have little to do with security within HabboUK.

>If this is taken onboard, then obviously replace everything in the rest of this doc w/ the chosen role.

## Plain Errors

- Missing W&P Sec from 1(1)
- 1(2)(f) mentions Dep. CoS (should be Cab. Sec. I believe)

## Americanisations

- 'authorize' in long title (should be changed to 'authorise')
- 'programs' in 1(2)\(c) (should be changed to 'programmes')

## Suggestions

### General Suggestions

- That this act be named 'The Home Department Act 2024' and the department be known as both the 'Home Office' and the 'Home Department' as this is moreso reflects real life.

- That, in line with the above suggestion, the post of 'The Home Secretary' be renamed to 'The Secretary of State for the Home Department', with its common name being 'The Home Secretary', again, in line with real life.

### Section 1   The Home Office

- 1(1) - This states that there shall be an HO, however this is already stated in the Gov. Act. Bit redundant, but doesn't really matter either way.

- 1(5) - "under the leadership of the Home \[Sec.]" is redundant as is stated in 1(2)(a)

- 1(6) - "All \[...] duties and responsibilities, shall be designated within this Act." is in conflict with next sentence: "These duties \[...] shall be published and updated \[...] on the \[HabboUK site]" Perhaps instead:
> The \[Home Sec.] shall publish the duties of the \[W&P Sec.] on the \[HabboUK Site].

- 1(7) - Problematic for 2 reasons
    1. This is covered by 2(7)(2) of the Government Act 2024 & the Government (Department Size Clarification) Act 2024
    2. This kinda conflicts with all of S2 since while MHRs aren't Ministers, they are of the HO.

    I suggest striking this line

### Section 2   The Mental Health Coalition

- 2(1) - No issues, other than the missing `.`, but I feel like "which shall, in this act, be henceforth known as 'MHRs'." would be nice and I'm including it for the sake of making my life easier.

- 2(2) - I feel this is worded weirdly as a whole. If you read 2(2) then 2(2)\(c) for instance, it doesn't flow in my opinion.

>I would suggest the following

>>"MHRs shall be tasked with completing the following."

- 2(2)(a) - Following on

>>"Member Check-ins &ndash; having two (2) conversations, each with one (1) member of staff of their assigned branch, about their wellbeing and how they are coping, and for other such purposes."

- 2(2)(a)(i) - It is unclear exactly what it means.
Presuming that is means MHRs will speak to a different branch each week it should say something like:

>>(i)     The \[W&P Sec.] shall assign a branch to each \[MHR] each week.

>>(ii)    Number of \[MHRs] permitting, a different branch shall be assigned than was the week prior.

- 2(2)(b) - Following on

>>"A Weekly Summary Report &ndash; a report to be submitted to the \[W&P Sec.], each week, consisting of any worries of either of the members of staff they spoke to. As well as anything which may need to be escalated to their respective branch leader, the Cabinet Office, or the entire Cabinet."

- 2(2)\(c) - Following on

>>"Ensuring Satisfaction Survey Completion &ndash; ensuring that their assigned branch has completed a satisfaction, to be completed monthly."

- 2(2)(d) - Following on

>>"A Monthly Summary Report &ndash; a report to contain information similar to that contained within the 'Weekly Summary Report'. As well as that which may be useful for the Home Office's monthly satisfaction report."

## Missing Punctuation

- 1(1)(a-b) - Missing `.` at the end of list.

- 2(1)(a) - Missing `.` at the end of the sentence.
To be honest this could be just merged into 2(1).

- 3(1) - NO COMMAS!?!?!? See below.

>>"The Prime Minister may, by order, amend Section 1 of this act."

- 3(2) - I sense a theme.

>>"The Home Secretary may, by order and with the approval of the House of Commons, amend Section 2 of this act."

- A bit more than punctuation tbh.

>>"3(3)      The ***Home Minister*** may, by order and with the approval of the House of Commons, amend the following sections of this act&mdash;"

>>"3(3)(i)       Section 2(1), in order to add or remove positions."

>>"3(3)(ii)      Section 2(2), in order to change tasking for mental health representatives."
